Invocation: comp [file] 
 My virtual machine is called VM

Ivocation would look like this. 

./comp file
or
comp file if you have current directory in your path.
Keyboard input is supported.
Same invocation without file but will produce kb.asm

All programs work as expected including the storage allcation test files. (except as noted below) 

Program 6 generates running code but output is incorrect.
